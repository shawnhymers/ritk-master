We believe it should be a destination in its own right, as we fell in love with the old town’s architecture and charm, as well as the city’s climate and sunsets. Our favourite thing to do was simply wander the city’s oldest neighbourhood, San Lázaro, which features some original buildings from the city’s inception by the Spanish in 1540. It’s nicknamed the white city as a majority of the buildings in this neighbourhood are built from white or pink volcanic rock. We also had a hard time passing up a sunset at Plaza de Armas, one of the most beautiful squares in Latin America (in our opinion.) It’s often called the land of volcanoes as they populate the skyline, and one of the best spots to see it is from the square where the church perfectly frames the city’s most well known volcano: Misti.
