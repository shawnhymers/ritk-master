You can get the day pass or the season pass which lasts from July-September. With either, you get unlimited access to the Whistler and Blackcomb gondola, peak to peak gondola, and the peak chair at the top of Whistler. These gondolas and chair lifts give you access to dozens of alpine hiking trails of different difficulty levels. What I love about this pass is that it gives you the ability to hike the alpine without having to hike up the mountain first. It also makes the alpine and it’s spectacular views accessible to folks of different ages and ability levels. Our favourite blue trail is Blackcomb’s Lakeside Loop and favourite black trail Whistler’s High Note Trail. (Pro tip: If you’re not down for the entire 9.4 km long high note trail, you can find the best views of the entire trail (photo below) by hiking about 20 mins past the fork that takes you up the half note. Once you’ve experienced those views, hike back to the fork and go up the half note instead. It saves you about 3 km of the most difficult terrain of the hike, but you don’t skip out on any of the best views.)'},

We appreciate that Whistler is finding as many ways as possible to reduce its environmental footprint and to preserve the mountain’s natural beauty as much as possible."},

Both Nita Lake and Rainbow Park have docks where you can launch inflatable paddle boards or kayaks if that’s your jam. This route allows you to see two of Whistler’s prettiest lakes accessible by the valley trail and is a really nice hour long walk. We recommend doing this as a morning activity considering how many nice breakfast/coffee options there are at Creekside.'}]},

During a certain period of time in the summer, there are a few weeks where toads cross the valley trail that leads to the lake so beware of that. When that happens the parking lot closes and the free shuttle bus can’t take you too close, but you can still get to it. Just be careful not to squish the little guys!'},

In fact, our expectations were wildly exceeded. We’ve been around the Lost Lake trails plenty of times in the summer, so we weren't expecting this to feel that different from our summer hike’s, but we felt like we were in a completely different place. The snowshoe trails are narrow and single file, run along creeks, and weave beneath stunning snow-covered trees. We felt like we were in a winter paradise. It helped that on the afternoon we went, we were met with light snowfall which added to the magic of it all. We rented snowshoes and paid for a day pass in order to do this which ended up being pretty expensive ($70 for the both of us.) At first we couldn’t believe how much we paid, but as we began experiencing the trails and how wonderfully they are maintained, we felt it was worth it. Our first snowshoe experience definitely spoiled us."},

They also donate to various carbon capture programs each year to address this deficit, essentially meaning their energy consumption is carbon neutral.
