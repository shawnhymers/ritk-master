Many of Whistler’s top dining options recommended through mainstream blogs/vlogs can hardly offer a salad to vegans which is a bummer for folks looking to celebrate a special occasion."},

The main dishes of their menu rotate based on what’s in season, which makes this restaurant a fun spot to stop by during every visit, as there is always something new. Despite their menu constantly changing, they promise to always have a quarter of their menu be vegan. (Which is a better percentage than most places in the town!) The Raven Room is also really well known for their cocktails, and if that’s not your thing, will make a really great mocktail as well.'},

It’s a beautiful place that brings us great joy whether we are dining there or not. We have dined there on multiple occasions for dinner and brunch, and for the purposes of this list we are highlighting their brunch menu. It’s one of the few places in Whistler where you can find more than one vegan option on a brunch menu, and they sure do not disappoint.'},

Both are unique spins on classic breakfast items that’ll leave you impressed and satisfied.'},

Their sourdough tartine’s have different toppings depending on the day as they are always switching things up depending on what’s in season. They remind me of pizza buns – but much more sophisticated! While you’re there, you must also pick up a loaf of sourdough bread or some of their incredible cinnamon rolls.

If you come during happy hour, a lot of our favourite dishes have a good discount on them. The only reason this isn’t on the list is that we find it can be hit or miss with them. It seems that depending on the chef, the menu items taste slightly different.'},
