For example, a round trip flight from LA to New York generates over 1,200 KG of Co2 per passenger. A shorter round-trip flight between London to Paris generates 218 KG of Co2. To put these numbers in perspective, the global average carbon footprint for an individual over an entire year is 4,734 KG. Although some populations produce much more: The average for Europe is 7,832 KG, Oceania is 9, 526.5 KG, and North America is 11,770 KG."},

Furthermore, there is a carbon cost associated with building and maintaining the required airport infrastructure to support the aerospace industry. "},

The contrails you can see sometimes trailing behind planes have a slight warming effect on the planet. The soot and water vapour deposited into the atmosphere during flight do as well. Interestingly, the nitrogen oxide produced during a flight warms the planet through ozone production and cools the planet through methane reduction. Long story short, when doing the calculations, all these indirect effects are summed up in what we call “non Co2 radiative forcing”."},
